## [Problem-1](https://github.com/Kibria-1822/t2021-2-1/blob/main/problem-1.js)

For this problem at first I declared a class call **Calculator** contains a constructor and its **require three arguments two are number a, b and a str.** The number are double and str is a string as per problem instruction. Then create a function named **calculate** for perform the operation bashed on the str arguments on the Class Constructor using Calculator instance you can perform your task.

## [Problem-2](https://github.com/Kibria-1822/t2021-2-1/blob/main/problem-2.js)

  

For this problem I create a function called **generateUnit** with one number argument. Then inside a function create a variable named **result** . Then **Iterate a loop from 1 to till the params value** and for each value of the loop store the calculated value in the result and return the value end of the loop.

## [Problem-3](https://github.com/Kibria-1822/t2021-2-1/blob/main/problem-3.js)

For this problem I create a function called **oneOutput** with one number argument. Then inside a function create a variable named **finalResult** . Then check the number **odd** or **even** if **odd number continue** with number else if **even** number change the number value with the **immediate previous odd number**. After that **Iterate a loop from 1 to till the params value** and for each value of the loop store the calculated value in the result and return the value end of the loop.

## [Problem-4](https://github.com/Kibria-1822/t2021-2-1/blob/main/problem-4.js)

For this Problem first create a function named **countMultiples** that require two array arguments one array is the for those I want the multiples of and another one for the array those multiple to be checked that instructed in Question. In the function create a variable **count** type object that store data for the multiples of each multiple element as a **key** and number of the multiple present the array as **Value**. After that render consecutive loop with multiples and array and check the multiple or not if multiple count value change respect to the key. and return the count as a final result.
